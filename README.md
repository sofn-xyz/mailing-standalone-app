# mailing-standalone-app

We built `mailing` for embedding in full-stack next.js, redwood, and remix apps. Some people have wanted to use it outside of one of those. This is a minimal example of how one might create a standalone app to use `mailing` for developing emails without a react web framework.

This should boot mailing with:
```
yarn
npx mailing
```
